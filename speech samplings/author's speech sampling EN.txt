What do you mean? The inside of the car was noisy again. I was a wolf. Walk, why walk any more? One by one, the adults gave up and piled their belongings over their heads and climbed down one by one. In the middle of the rice fields of the vast Saga Plains, there flows a river that has rejected us. Like my parents, I hate studying maps, and I don't even know the existence or name of the river. I know that letting my sisters walk any longer would be worse than killing them. We force ourselves to suppress our anxious hearts and decide to wait until they come out. The conductor must have thought that since we were the only ones in the train, we were quite exceptional. But this time too, we were not abandoned. The train soon left after a curt greeting.
Her voice was small, but it was full of joy.
The head nurse adjusts her body before she gets stiff. It was strange how those thin white hands could easily move the body of a person who had been unable to control them until now. I was frightened and snuggled into my sister's bed on the other side.
The intense anxiety about home was once again weighing on my mind, but I was quickly distracted by my busy schedule. The garden, hallways, and rooms became strangely crowded with people arriving one after another. It's a shame that it's okay. There are those who are unconscious and put into a coma under the watchful eyes of their teachers, those who stare at the horrific lacerations in their flesh, those who stare at their ten-thick arms and grit their teeth, those who continue to vomit into buckets with a burning fever. Mr. Sakai. Eventually, Mr. Kitahara brought me a can of campan and a can of sugar that he had buried deep in the mountain. That's right, our lunch box went flying into the air along with its contents. This morning, I made some tsukudani and green bean stew next to my mom and added it as a side dish.
When Teruichi said this without hesitation as he was leaving the house, Michiko patted him on the shoulder and sent him on his way.
Around the time of August 15th, which occurred every year, Michiko refrained from reading newspapers, magazines, or listening to the radio. She is the one who hates these reports from the bottom of her heart. If the voice on the radio that accidentally came out was talking about the atomic bomb, Michiko looked like a child convulsing with a high fever.
As soon as Kiichi finished speaking, he yawned loudly. In any case, I was released and the tension in my body suddenly eased.
I looked away, trying to shake off the image of my wife who had collapsed. However, it was like the only bright screen in a movie theater. Before I could cry out, my eyes were drawn to her again. I remembered the negative and cold impression I received from Mrs. Oha and the words of Yukie Oha.
I clutched the dirty hat I had put on in one hand, squeezed the lunch wrapper under my arm, and stepped on the cobblestone pavement, my chest heaving like a boy's.
One day, in the middle of a staff meeting, Uenoshin hurt his leg.
In the end, I honestly told him about my relationship with Uenoshin, and told him that I was very surprised to hear of his death, but that I wanted him to tell me anything he knew about him.
When I grabbed the knife, I felt a heavy weight in my hand, and I realized that this was the bayonet I had attached to the end of the 38 rifle that my grandfather had always talked about. This thing killed a man, and that's why the old man carried it around in his pocket for ten years and never opened it. The khaki shirt, pants, water bottle, and stationery that I received from the army have all disappeared, but this is the only one left, and that's why it's my grandfather's treasure.
The man spoke to himself.
Now I can eat all this stuff to my full stomach.
I asked the old man softly. The old man didn't answer or even look at me. The old man's eyes do not see a burning town, but his open eyes see blood gushing out into the edges of the dark night and into the distant chasms that irregularly shape the edges. Only. Normally, I would have gone to bed long ago, but why am I sitting here? Why is the town burning and the dead people lying around? Where did my mom go? I don't know so many things. Sometimes, I forget to even cry , and if I want to drink water, I go to the river by myself, and if that doesn't work, I go back to the old man. Even if they don't say anything, it's like they've all accepted it in their little minds, as if it's been there all along and there's no way they can escape it. But in my heart, I'm obsessed with these horrible things like a stick of candy in my hand, and I'm trying to shut them up in a hard shell so that even when I grow up, I'll never remember them. It seemed like he was doing it.
...A perfectly square, narrow, 2.5 square meter room... I wonder if this is a hospital room or an isolated cell. However, we have no choice but to live a little lighter and lighter. Light, light, the sweet sleep of the air that enveloped me at dawn, soft as a feather. ...Someone must be praying for me constantly. ...I'm absentmindedly chasing thoughts that don't touch me forever in bed.
For some time now, the owner of this house had been discreetly reminding me to see a doctor. I timidly ducked through the hospital gate once. The doctors didn't tell me anything other than that I was weak. It actually made me laugh. How can I, a penniless person, take care of myself during such a horrible season of famine? All I could do was keep my starving body as quiet as possible, trying not to get tired. However, the eyes of the wife of this house as she looked at me were not calm from the beginning when I started taking care of her in this house. It was getting more and more bitter. The starch ration suddenly ran out, and there were days when I had to settle for nothing but vegetables and water. Then, one day, the wife of this house finally exploded. I felt like a dog thrown to the ground. The guilt of being homeless seemed to drive me crazy. I started to get scared. By myself, I was placed in a state of isolation from the people in this house. My husband looked at me with pity in his eyes, but he was already shy and didn't say anything. My wife was clearly avoiding seeing me. But what was crushed and trapped inside, the eerieness of this whole house, silently surrounded me. And as long as I'm in this room, this will be a constant torment. This low, white, fragile-looking ceiling...the glass window next to my sleeping head...the opposite wall just below my feet...
When I returned to my hometown with your urn, my brother showed me an old album at his house. Among the old photos, I found a familiar face for the first time in a while. It was a photo of my older sister who passed away when I was a boy. I was amazed that such a kind and cute girl existed in this world, and even felt proud that I was her younger brother. My sister died two years after we got married, so I wouldn't call her a daughter, but in my eyes, there was something so cute and pure smiling at me that it felt like it was tightening my heart. . I cherished that image etched into my eyes. From then on, I started to indulge in this kind of imagination from time to time. If you are dead and traveling in a faraway world, please go and visit my dead sister. However, I believe that this prayer has now been granted. It's like I can feel the beautiful encounter between you and my sister in a faraway place that my eyes can't reach.
I could faintly see something that looked like white paper on the table next to the glass wall. If I remember correctly, that's where my food is always kept. I walk gingerly across the floorboards. I sat down on the chair, feeling like I was crawling into it. When I carefully removed the newspaper from the table, I saw that there was something to eat on it.
This area used to be Hasuda, but due to the expansion of the military academy, it has expanded into other areas. After I finished studying, I happened to run into a middle-aged woman I knew by sight, near the roadside where the military academy's instructor's quarters were lined up. This year, my son is a teacher at an elementary school on this island who was accepted into the same prefectural junior high school in Hiroshima that I attended, but after losing his husband and raising him alone, this child has finally entered the junior high school he wanted to attend. I haven't come back since that day.
When I saw the sad expression on Homomote's face, I had no choice but to call out to her.
It was so fast that I thought I might get an upset stomach because I couldn't digest it. Of course, there was no way for me to intervene.
On the way down, I couldn't help but hurry and arrived at the gates of the military academy. Until the other day, the guards were standing ready in their formal uniforms with bayonets, but now that the war has been defeated, they are standing there, unarmed, with their battle caps on the wrong side, and it looks strange and uncool. The road started to move forward, but perhaps it was just my imagination, but I felt like the ice was melting faster.
In broad daylight, a number of white canes appeared in my mind. The tips of their white canes made a chirping sound as they crowded down the narrow, yellow road. My sister pointed diagonally to the sky. I said thank you, said farewell to my sister, and climbed the slope leading to Temple E alone. There was a greengrocer in the middle of the hill. When I came back, my sister tapped me on the shoulder.
You're right, August 9th was a tough day for both the building and the people, I said, taking the principal's words.
Kinuko stroked the trunk of the oak with her palm and lowered her eyes. That momentary expression was not the expression of a person who died instantly. His expression was astonished as he asked why! That's why I feel like I'm still alive somewhere, asking someone why. The reason why he has not visited the grave to this day is because his body has never been found and he is considered among the dead. He said he was scared to hear that.
On the night of the 9th, a light rain fell in Nagasaki. The rain was a blessing to the students who suffered burn injuries. The cold air of the rain felt good on my body, which was covered with wounds and blood.
The girl stammered. He didn't seem to feel any pain in his wrist. Takashi timidly put his hand on the girl's shoulder again and silently pulled her away, keeping his eyes in the direction she was going. The girl moved her legs and at the same time grabbed Takashi's wrist as if clinging on to him. Takashi started running again. But he wasn't aware of what he was doing now.
Takashi suddenly withdrew his hand and shouted.
At the same time as Takashi said this, he suddenly realized the weight of the light machine gun he had lifted while being chased by an assault bugle, after his muscles were exhausted to the point that he couldn't move his legs during the field exercise. I remembered.
Words are lost between the two. Takashi looked away. ``I've grown...'' In his head, Takashi looked at Kiyoko hungrily. The tone of the letters that came to the factory dormitory did not change much, and here and there they gave off an innocent quality in unexpected places.
As is the case everywhere in the mountains of the Chugoku region, the top of a low mountain pass is the border of a village, and as you descend from there, the valley widens little by little, with small mountain fields and small mountain fields that always have poor sanitation. The mountain fields are terraced all the way down to the flatlands of the village.
So what exactly is causing this strange trend? Most likely it is due to the occupation policy of the country that dropped the atomic bomb. As is now well known, the large-scale occupation army hospital built in Hiroshima was originally called the Atomic Bomb Injury Investigation Committee. Its purpose was to investigate injuries, and it was not a place to treat the 100,000 survivors of the atomic bombing. The occupation forces adopted a policy of repression as much as possible to prevent the spread of atomic bomb disease, and about five years after the atomic bombing, the American government made an extraordinary announcement. The fact that even today, one Japanese person dies of atomic bomb disease every five days clearly proves how far-fetched nonsense this announcement is. At that time, the occupation forces and the Japanese government were extremely indifferent to the medical examinations and treatment of atomic bomb survivors, so 300,000 atomic bomb survivors were left in the wild and scattered across the country. It is now too late for treatment and there is nothing that can be done.
Since then, more than 20 years have passed since that morning, after having lost all of his family and possessions, and having been stranded before he was even born, he finally arrived at his hometown, dragging his limp legs, and found a place in a corner of the basement. It was decided that he would somehow be able to live in a porcelain house. The next night, on the way back from work in the neighboring village, Mansuke saw a fifth-dan judo player, who looked like the Matsuda-ya teacher, raiding the fields on the mountain road below the mountain pass.
However, even after taking the last bus of the night or going underground, Okume still did not return home, so her husband came to visit Mansuke's ash shop, causing an uproar. Most likely, he had either thrown himself into the depths of Umega Valley or hanged himself in the mountains, so people in the neighborhood searched for him until late at night. Because of this, I was unable to find it properly and postponed the search to the next day. The next morning, he easily discovered Okume's corpse hanging from an oak branch on the mountain behind the Okinoya house where she married her husband.
But why are you telling me this?
It's not that Kibihiko particularly liked this image of Dr. Kerrel. Of course, I have no connection with him as he is a student in the Liberal Arts Department. The great doctor, who was a first-class medical officer in the Northern Federal Army of Germany in the 19th century, wore a protruding helmet shaped like the tip of a plant, had moldings hanging from the epaulettes on both shoulders, and wore the Iron Cross and six other medals. It was a grand start with the hanging of medals.
Going to Japan?! Regarding his plans in Japan and other matters, he leaves it to Professor Otoya Ide, the only Japanese person he knows directly, and he has a policy of keeping his affairs a secret. It was clear, but what kind of secrets could be kept in today's world? Even in a mental hospital, secrecy was difficult to keep. Sometimes even he himself had to ask for keys in hospitals, where he proclaimed freedom from keys, avoiding outside attacks. The sound of a gong echoes from the open door. It's lunch. The outside world is calling to him.
When asked,
As I was cooped up and cowering in the head with a blanket over my head, a man heard footsteps and came closer to me, whispering something to me. When I looked up, the man who looked like he was looking at me made a face like, ``Huh?'' Then, he put his finger to his lips and said, ``Shh.'' Then, I heard a tremendous, indescribable growl coming from next to his head. He put his finger to his lips again and went back to his bed, whispering something to the groaning man next to him.
 Without thinking, I covered my tattered front with my hand. Everyone laughed again, thinking that was strange. The puppy, called Lassie, exaggeratedly said that this was his own accomplishment, stretched out his throat and barked, and when I looked at him, he bared his young fangs and threatened me. .
With his teeth showing, he seemed to want to hear my reply, and stood faithfully while I opened the envelope and read it. —We are alive. You probably won't believe it though.
My legs, tired from walking, trembled for a while after I calmed down. Although his teeth had finally stopped shaking, a sick feeling began to crawl through his body, and he appeared to have a high fever. If I fall asleep, I won't fall, I thought to myself as I peered into a very different place from here. If I had been asked to climb again, I wouldn't have had the strength to do it again, I thought to myself in the back of my mind. I wanted a bowl. I have no choice but to spend the night here and go scouting again towards the river. In particular, in his worse condition than the beggar, he could no longer walk anywhere outside the village, except under the pretense of returning from a swim in the river. With a loud, piercing cry, a black bird suddenly fluttered its wings, and something that looked like a small black beast ran past, making a sound like scraping metal, but this only made the silence before it even blacker and deeper. I made it into something. Alone, I tried to whistle an old, childish whistle toward the silent forest that was permeated by the refreshing night air after the rain. To drive away sleepiness and night terrors. The night in the forest was still scary. I played the simple melody of ``Old Negro Joe'' over and over again, going back to my childhood when I played the Three Musketeers and played in the woods. ...The days when I was young and energetic are gone. ...All my friends left the cotton fields. ...That whistle, accompanied by overtones, rose to the dense camphor treetops, as if it could reach the stars, and made my feverish body transparent. ``Leave this land and go to a better country. I hear the voice my friends call me, sweet and gentle, the voice they call Old Black Joe. 〉 A flare was fired near the edge of the forest. During the blink of an eye, the forest was illuminated with an unexpectedly vivid and colorful green, but it slowly trailed off and gradually faded, leaving me silent and unwilling to answer, returning to the darkness of the forest. It was swallowed up . I repeated ``Old Black Joe'' one more time, whistling low and rasping between my teeth. Strangely enough, I missed the flares searching for me.
Hiroshi said that the grandmother's thoughts came first after all, and asked Tatsu that night.
Well, a dead person is a dead person. No matter how much I think about it, there's no way I'll ever come back. Now that the end is over, I have to think about living people... The first generation thought this while watching Hiroshi, who was often at home during summer vacation. Haruko married five years ago and already has two children. My mother-in-law, Tatsu, is over 70 years old, but she still doesn't seem to be living alone. It has been more than ten years since I first started working in the elementary school's emissary's office, but I am still not complaining. Suddenly, the first generation's feelings fell on Hiroshi.
Contrary to plan, Hiroshi wasn't surprised.
After saying that, Hiroshi creaked up the stairs and went up to the second floor.
When I went up to the second floor after the first round of carrier-based air raids, I found that Black smoke was rising from the shadow of the mountain directly opposite. There should have been a plane somewhere around there. He said he would come back tomorrow, but All that day I heard nothing from Second Lieutenant Somiya, and I lapsed into a sleep, anxious. Although I wish I could go to the base, I was so scared that I couldn't even get close to the airfield, which was burning even more intensely as the night progressed, probably due to a gasoline tank catching fire. I sat at the bay window and watched the flames of the fire in a daze.
For the first time, he sounded like an older brother before he was summoned.
No wonder. It's been two years since I joined the military and I haven't seen him.
I walked up and down the Akasha road, the usual train stop near my house, two or three times, pretending to be waiting for a train. Hiroshima's roadside trees, which were thought to have died due to the atomic bombing, are now sprouting buds this summer, with their lush leaves waving in the breeze. I stood in the shadow, absentmindedly spinning the parasol in my hand.
When I asked him what he meant , the shorter student wiped his lips with the back of his hand.
What should I do? I hear a low wave-like voice deep in my ears again.
That's strange, you're such a nice person. I'm staying because I want to know not just the Hiroshima of August 6th, but another Hiroshima. Another Hiroshima?
However, on the other hand, it is also true that the voices of atomic bomb survivors are becoming more and more widespread, saying that nothing can be done if things continue as they are. One of the forces that has emerged over the past year is the frustration of not being able to leave things to others anymore, based on twenty years of despair and the foolishness of division and conflict.
When I saw that big bulge,
I raised my hand in greeting, turned left along the school's stone wall, and quickly left. His shadow moved busily. After the man I was with left, I felt a great deal of fatigue in my shoulders. And the whole day I moved around with him looked like a comic book movie. That guy and I were both completely out of sorts. Unable to resist the sense of humor welling up in me, I stood in the middle of the road and laughed out loud. Strangely enough, I didn't have any major concerns. When morning comes, the first thing I do is go to the elementary school where I work, make sure the students are safe, and then head over to Mitsu's parents' house. Mitsu will probably laugh in a way that makes Kashiwako look like an idiot while stroking her big belly that hasn't grown yet.
When he said that, he laughed in a strange voice.
Shuzo went.
It's not like there are any strange decorations or people you know. It was my first time in this city, and it was just an ordinary scene in a room.
 He is conscious of the illusion that pushing it forward forcefully can hide something. There was no deadline, so there was some uncertainty. However, there was no need to come to such a city for the script of the short TV drama. If you were looking for a glimpse of materials, the library would probably be sufficient, and collecting materials was something he didn't like to begin with.
I find Tetsuo's sensitive nerves to be annoying, as he gave Minako the unpleasant impression he had made in such a short amount of time. In short, it was all a matter of feeling free. A boat carrying a woman with a parasol and a young man floated by. The man rests his oars and dips his hands in the water. Eventually, the parasols began to sway, and the woman seemed to be following the man's example. However, the woman's submerged hand cannot be seen from here. The boat was still floating, and the children on the shore were sitting on the stone steps, peering into each other's buckets.
Aki Kawai came down the stairs with a bouncy step, wearing a plaid skirt and a pair of white and brown saddle shoes. Ichiyo's business card was at the reception desk. I recognized the business card with the title "Curatorial Department Reporter" on it. Aki Kawai showed a big expression of shock, just like a foreigner would. This spring, she was featured in an evening newspaper with a photo included. It was a series of articles published in the evening newspaper that interviewed women in the workplace, and Kaji, accompanied by a cameraman, paid attention to the special workplaces of A, B, C, and C. . It was Shohei Kagi who introduced her to Kaji, who suddenly made her an ordinary girl famous. Aki Kawai had abandoned Shohei Kagi. His appearance in the evening paper made her remember how men looked at her in a different way, so much so that it became so embarrassing that she had been in love with only one man, Akira Kagi, for so long. Aki Kawai began to feel confident. My astonishment at newspapers now borders on admiration. This article seemed to be the trigger for George Matsuda's marriage proposal. He made her his secretary by appointment dated June 1st. My monthly salary had doubled. The summer beach is on fire. And the beach at night burned mysteriously and ached. autumn. On Aki Kawai's finger was a brilliant five-carat diamond. I thought everything was at stake on this diamond. The brilliance of this diamond may have been promised to me when that man visited with his cameraman.
———Kaji closed his eyes for a long time. I am not moved by the approaching end of the year. However, he couldn't help but feel that immense anxiety, something he didn't know what it was, was coming closer and closer to his feet. When I closed my eyes, I felt a sense of fatigue, mixed in with the noise of the city, pressing down on my shoulders and neck.
George Matsuda was calculating. It is wrong to speak ill of people on strike. There will be animosity towards me, and my position as a second-generation person will also be hated. Newspaper reporters can do nothing but stir things up. The pen is mightier than the sword. The unofficial emperors reward those with whom they have goodwill, and exact punishment on those with whom they feel bad. The first thing to do is to be liked. He is an ally of the Japanese people. And then there are the pitiful second generation who are suffering between themselves and the tyrannical white people. But the white people here are not bad people. I'm not the kind of person who would launch an atomic bomb. They are peaceful scientists who are trying to save the victims and prevent such a disaster from happening again. I know rumors that A, B, C, and С will examine patients but not provide treatment. However, there are no specifications regarding arithmetic. He intends to develop new treatments in the near future. However, when it comes to treatment and treatment, there is currently no medicine. The medicine was born from the results of 1,000 days of research conducted by A, B, C, and С. The white people here are not soldiers who like to fight. Nor is it a building under military control. They're all good gentlemen. But inside this building, we are just people being used. There are complaints and dissatisfaction. I am heartbroken about this latest strike. The reason why he can't take a strong stance against white people is because he knows the truth: they don't want to behead him by force. It is true that there are too many people. It is desirable to achieve maximum research results with fewer people. I would rather give hope for tomorrow to five sick and unfortunate people than to have one healthy person lost on the streets. For that to happen, wouldn't decapitation be unavoidable? That is the true rarity of being a scientist, and nothing else. One white person was dazzled by me. I want money now. If we had the money, we would be able to provide treatment and we would not have to behead our cute friend. ...George Matsuda spelled out the calculated words and finished speaking. It was eloquent. With loud gestures, he speaks of the goodness of white people and expresses sympathy for the Japanese. And he appeals to his own suffering in this second generation. Occasionally, Kaji would stop writing notes and look up at the strangely moving nature of this second-generation man. His voice and expression were disgusting. The nasalized Japanese came through with a strange intonation. Those words sounded like an amateur translation. He seems to be impressed by himself. Words like dead. It reminds me of an actor reading his lines literally. He says he is worried. It seems like he enjoys the word 'worry'. Even as he thought about this, Kaji found himself nodding enthusiastically as he struck the hammer one by one. A sad, sad habit. It seemed like his career as a newspaper reporter was on the cards. The act of nodding may not mean agreeing with the other person. However, it felt like a vaguely false pose. There was a faint pain. The pain of nodding. Kaji felt as though he had been captivated by these turbulent emotions a lot lately, and remained absent-minded for a while after the other person had finished speaking. Then, pretending to be listening to what the other person was saying, Kaji nodded strongly once or twice in return. As I nodded, I couldn't help but feel a slight wave of self-loathing wash over me. For some reason, the stars suddenly feel hatred toward George Matsuda. I suddenly had no idea what the nature of that hatred was.
The cameraman was busy moving around, kneeling on the floor, putting his face close to Aki's body. The newspaper reporter turned his cold, stiff face toward the window, as if covered in lead. He looked extremely irritated and frightened, as if he didn't like the cameraman's actions. The cameraman's low voice sounded as if he had swallowed mercury. Even I was annoyed. A small man with curly hair, a pockmarked face, and a penis walked back and forth around me, stopping, kneeling, and holding his camera. It seemed like an awfully long time, but it wasn't more than four or five minutes. However, at that moment, this person was facing the window, making a frightening face, as if enduring pain. While posing, the profile of his face made me concerned. ,・Miss, please try talking to someone. The cameraman pointed at the reporter at the window with his camera held close to his chest. Aki spoke to Kaji, and when Kaji turned around in response, a pale flash of light flashed across Muroichi. What happened? At that moment, the man's lips wrinkled and he stood still. Takao looked agitated, a combination of shock and anger. Pale pain oozed from every inch of his body . I wonder what happened. The reporter stood there for a while, and the next moment he was leaning against the wall, as if on his knees. Aki Kawai quietly chuckled. The scene at that time was strange, but from an outsider's perspective, it was also so hideous that I couldn't help laughing. Smiling, Aki Kawai stood next to the sofa where Kaji was sitting. While feeling the gaze of the nurses at the reception desk. It's like he's close to a journalist, or even proud of it. Kaji looked blankly. The woman was smiling. He blinked, standing up as if startled. It certainly looks familiar. ———Kaji had forgotten. ———I have a lot to say about that section. Aki Kawai never stops smiling. Along with the tremendous flash of light, Kaji also remembered Aki Kawai's name. It reminded me of something unpleasant. Kaji's face scrunched up a little, but then a smile appeared on his face. While laughing, I felt a pain deep in my eyeballs. That was probably a prank on cameraman Kizuka's part. He knows that I hate flashes of flash, of magnetism. They're telling me that I'm a coward. That little man. The man, who only attended elementary school, was a true engineer who worked his way up from being a waiter at a newspaper company. That cameraman looked down on the young college-educated reporter. He probably has a sense of inferiority. I get depressed and get depressed. Certainly, at that time, it was the malicious work of cameraman Kizuka. I can only think so.
Sakanmachi's eldest son had already been drafted, but his second son had entered the military academy from Shudo Junior High School. I felt a deep sense of regret for the people close to me who were fighting in the war one after the other. Citizens were also wondering why the enemy was neglecting Hiroshima, the largest metropolis in the Chugoku region. Although air raid warnings were issued almost every night, the ships always took a fixed course of passing over the sky, passing into the Sea of Japan, and dropping mines. It was on a certain day in July when Kure was attacked in waves by enemy carrier-based planes and was destroyed.It was a chilling experience. Even in Hiroshima, I heard the heart-wrenching sound of an explosion, and although I was frightened in the air-raid shelter, I felt as if it was finally Hiroshima's turn.
I passed in front of the Japanese Red Cross Hospital and the university. My sister must have safely evacuated to the school. I didn't notice that. They are led by a teacher. I can't do what I want. I'll see you when I go to school. Yukihashi is almost there---I suddenly regained my energy.
Naturally, they would have taken shelter in an air raid shelter, and I think there would have been better means of defense. Even though it probably wouldn't have helped anything because it was an atomic bomb and an air raid warning had been issued, I'm sure they wouldn't have bothered to stick their heads out in the scorching heat of 50 million degrees.
Afterword: This book was created at the strong recommendation of Takeshi Yasuda and Chugoku Shimbun's Takashi Hiraoka and Minoru Omuta three years ago. Indirectly, he continued to write while feeling the silent encouragement of the atomic bomb victims and his late mother, Tokiko Kanai. When she was young, her mother became a disciple of Professor Saneatsu Mushakoji, and also helped care for evacuees from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in Miyoshi City, Hiroshima Prefecture.
Many of the personal opinions expressed in this article are similar to mental gymnastics, and should be taken as a list of problems rather than a strong opinion. The appendix at the end of the book is a memorandum of mine written before I learned about the development of grassroots activities such as the A-bomb map restoration movement in Hiroshima.
Even after I finished writing the manuscript for this book, various ``grassroots'' movements are progressing in Hiroshima. In addition to the campaign to restore the map of the atomic bombing, plans to produce an expanded version of the film documenting the atomic bombing are also being promoted by Hiroshima City (chairman Masafusa Yamamoto). The documentary film from Columbia University, compressed into 15 minutes, does not introduce the current situation of the atomic bomb survivors, and only records the past, so it is necessary to include the current situation. I was taught what it means to be human in Hiroshima. In that sense, the citizens of Hiroshima are my benefactors.
When the school where he worked was on summer vacation, he would spend time in this town with his wife and only son. I still don't understand why so many people go to summer resorts like Karuizawa. I was able to escape Tokyo not by avoiding the heat, but by embracing it. For me, summer was about living a true summer experience. During the suffocating heat of the evening, windless conditions, and the intense sunlight during the day, I sat patiently at my desk. No, I had decided that I had to endure it. However, the symptoms of measles continued for the past six months. It seemed to get worse as the summer progressed, but I refused to go to the hospital. Maybe he was avoiding medical attention. I chose the library over the hospital. I started to think of myself as a loser of summer because I started going to the newly built prefectural library, which had an air-conditioning system, and from this crushing feeling of defeat, a sense of bitterness dripped from me.
I had planned to write a paper to be published in the Bulletin. My graduation thesis was about the relationship between the ancient funeral system and elegies, and I seem to have chosen this theme because I am interested in funerals. In order for death to have a fundamental meaning, isn't a ritual necessary? In other words, death first finds expression through rituals. If it were not for the ritual of mourning shrines, many excellent elegies would not have been created for the shrines, including Crown Prince Hinami of Hitomaro, who was in the Manyo district. The paper in the Bulletin was intended to be titled ``Urashima Child Study''. The fact that Urashimako is recorded in the Nihon Shoki, Man'yoshu, and Tango no Kuni Fudoki proves how ancient it has been. The story of Urashimako in these oldest scrolls in Japan is quite different from the story of Urashima Taro that we know. There is no element of an animal tribute story to help the turtle. According to the Nihon Ryoiki, he began as the ancestor of the great lords of Mitani District in Bingo Province, which is present-day Fusan District in Hiroshima Prefecture. This became the story of Uji Shurei in the 13th century, and the main character was a person from Amagasa. There are quite a few differences between Eimizue Urashimako's long poems and tanka poems in Volume 9 of Man'yoshu, and Nihon Shoki and Fudoki.
The surface made of granite quicksand reflected the summer light brightly, and the cumulonimbus clouds could be seen rising with sharp white lines against the clear sky. In the afternoon, lightning occasionally rips through the cloud layers, but there is no echoing thunder. As this state began to persist, I suddenly felt a sharp sense of anxiety and dizziness. I ran to the window and wanted to hear for myself the thunder that was definitely rolling. It's like I'm scratching the window glass with my fingernails while I'm in a calm place where nothing is happening. It seemed like a slick, empty existence. I feel the coldness of the glass on my forehead, and once again become aware of the hot lump inside.
The fence had already been removed, leaving only scattered boards and walls. I looked around the area, but I couldn't remember anything. I stood there with my arms folded. 
This is the reply of a woman who is indifferent. Shozo tried to find the optimistic part in the woman's words. Not much was saved, but I took it as a little. Shozo's dried underwear stuck coldly to the skin of his stomach, and then became lukewarm. The woman was walking unsteadily, completely oblivious to the reaction her answer had on the other person. The two of them were well past Inasabashi-dori, the old streetcar stop. I was walking along the train tracks. A small crowd of people can be seen in front of the train tracks that extend in a straight line. From this distance, it suddenly seemed to Shozo that the crowd had something to do with the man who had fallen off the deck.
The woman tied up her thin hair in one hand and let it fall weakly. Shozo saw a slight hint of flattery appear on the woman's face. The woman who saw the shadow of death in herself suddenly envied the happiness of the man beside her. It seems that the hearts of the unhappy often respect the happy rather than worship them. However, Shozo, on the other hand, smells death in women and gradually begins to feel jealous of them. This is because Shozo also thought that he was unhappy. Rather than feeling pity for a woman who was more unlucky than himself, Shozo's unhappy heart regarded the woman as something evil simply because she was more unlucky than him. However, it wasn't that he wished for the woman's happiness. Judging from Shozo's feelings at this time, whether he was a happy or unhappy person had to have been determined from birth. I wanted to think that no matter how unhappy I was, my misfortune was within the limits of the happy race. The reason why Shozo thought of women as evil was because the unfortunate existence of women forced him to undergo such emotionally impossible efforts. Shozo, who had never experienced an atomic bomb, had a deep-rooted feeling in his heart that it was all about him, as if he were the center of the world. On the other hand, the woman was able to honestly envy Shozo, who was happier than her, precisely because she had long ago given up on this ``limitation to herself''.
urged the woman. The woman followed silently. The two went out on the road.
That's when I saw a white granite torii gate, standing on one leg, in the distance beyond the waves of rubble. Suddenly, the man woke up. He glared at Shozo with a dull look, then looked outside. For a moment, the man looked at the outside scene in a lazy posture with no expression on his face. The man's eyes blinked furiously. As if he had been shot, he raised his head and sat on his knees.
It was on that day that I felt like writing a letter to my old friend Katita, with whom I had only exchanged New Year's cards. There was no special pressing matter; I was just asked about the whereabouts of my middle school classmate. The replies I received listed the names, occupations, and addresses of about ten people. It was there.
Inagaki tried to be careful.
Tea was served. An incense holder and a teacup were placed quietly on top of a small round tea table that was common in newlywed families before the war. There was no teapot. The tea was close to plain water. There were no cushions either. I sipped silently.
Inagaki continued. "'He's a stubborn person and won't tell me he's in pain. When he sees that he's upset and asks for help, he then refuses to give me painkiller injections.' I was clearly being asked to make some kind of judgment, but I wasn't at that stage yet. I didn't even nod.
She is seriously inviting him. Now that I was alone, I was exhausted by the weight that had doubled in size. As he said, simply visiting one sick person will not solve the problem at all. It was probably because I happened to be an acquaintance of mine that made me decide to take this action, but just visiting was completely out of the question. So what will happen to me? Death will surely come to that patient. And what will happen to that sick wife left in the small house? I was afraid that I would become a continuation of one act or hypocrisy.
Memorial service,
A dark blue hat walks out of the crowd in front of the statue of a thousand cranes. It was definitely him. I shielded myself from the sunlight with my hands and got caught up in the flow of people in front of me. I tried to call out to him , but he seemed to be turning his thoughts inward as he walked quickly and absorbedly, refusing to let me speak to him. They were restless medaka, swimming in groups around the water bowl, with a strong sense that they were not connected to each other. People continue to join the crowd from all sides who cannot leave.
I didn't have the energy to get up, and the pain of being greeted while I was still sleeping remained with me forever. But in the end, it was my illness that brought him to me.
In the evening of that day, I apparently arrived at Sakawa's house in Akitsu Town.
The words stabbed Fudeya's hesitant heart. Futeya doesn't know about the amazing Nagasaki. I felt like he was saying that. Fudetani visited the Morofuji family with a knowing look on his face, showing that he wanted to know the whereabouts of Murakoshi rather than to offer condolences to his younger brother Hideo. Futeya repeated it in a sing-song tone, as if to make excuses.
It was certainly a gentle voice from a peaceful era. Until recently, the urgent voice of the announcer was followed by the sound of an air raid warning buzzer, followed by the sound of B-29s swarming from the south and west, but those air raids have suddenly stopped. There were rumors that US troops would land at the end of the month. Someday the military government will be punished. There were whispers that all the men would be killed, castrated, or forced into forced labor. Apparently, women and girls around Kanagawa began to evacuate to the mountains. Newspapers wrote articles every day about how to treat soldiers of the occupation forces. When I saw headlines like this, I suddenly realized how obvious their meaning was. Something unprecedented is about to happen in this country.
War has destroyed humanity and left countless deaths upon the earth. One day, when Death is delivered through the door, the family gathers around the black creature and grieves with each other. The anomaly can be a condensed entity, or it can be a dark atmosphere that spreads throughout the house, robbing it of light.
The white light of the moon filled the doorway through which Tomoda had just exited. I woke up. My body feels unbearably tired. I have a feeling that my hair will start falling out soon . I spat into my palm. Then he hurried to the door and stretched out his palm in the moonlight.
A surprising number of people said they were womanizers. It seems that there are also women. Because there are few men, women are carrying on. This seemed to be the man who had taken possession of the woman. It was probably self-destruction. I don't know if it was a feeling of sadness that bordered on despair.
I was about to call again but stopped. It was because I saw someone in the shadows of the bushes.
I waved my fist in front of my face.
2: Number four?”
Just like us, 300,000 people died in Hiroshima alone due to a one-pen atomic bomb. In this war, Japan lost two million lives. The number of lost people around the world is frightening. Why is there a war? I cannot bear to see good men, good women, and even young, innocent lives being killed for the sake of those who love war and the few who profit from war. A beautiful world of peaceful people is something the human world cannot hope for, so please let it go.
It's the same day as my father's death anniversary, so we celebrate the festival together. I'm sure she's singing that cheerful song on the lap of her loving mother, making her happy.
That's what I said,
Only that man acted differently. The car soon turned into a side street, and as I casually watched him, I saw the man's slow steps gradually receding from where he had stopped. Come to think of it, judging by the way he carries himself, it seems like he's changed quite a bit. By the looks of it, he was a thin, tall man from the early 19th century, with a pale complexion that looked like a sickly conscripted soldier, but he was wearing an old, authentic-looking Panama hat on his head, and a light blue, short-sleeved shirt. Wearing dark blue pants and white sneakers, he looked just like he was on a normal day , and was out and about. He didn't wear any gaiters or anything that looked like air defense clothing.
... At first, my consciousness was so vague that I felt like I was hiding somewhere in the middle of nowhere. It wasn't a big place at all, but something like a thick wall, with no windows, and I felt like I was trapped in shoes... But anyway, I had been unconscious for a long time, and now I was finally coming to my senses. He wondered if he could have done that. What on earth was going on ? Was I having some kind of strange dream ? It didn't seem like that was the case. My head feels cloudy and unresponsive, and I don't think I can think of anything straight. It feels like I've been in a sleep for a very long time, never to wake up again, but now, slightly conscious of the darkness around me, I'm trying to solve the mystery in my own way. This is so strange. Isn't something really wrong? ...The sudden shock of that moment remains in my vague memory. There's no way you'll survive if you get hit by that awesome guy from close range. Yes, I did die at that time. Even so, I can feel vaguely now. Then, isn't this proof that he didn't die completely at that time, and that some kind of fragment of his consciousness still remains on earth? It would be a relief if I could touch it directly with my fingertips and confirm my existence, but for some reason such a simple thing seems impossible. Then, it seems like there's nothing I can do about it, so I don't panic, and I think there's no way I can do anything other than accept this incredibly strange feeling that won't go away and quickly get used to it. Isn't there...
At the very least, the feeling of floating in the air, floating in the air in a random direction, letting the cool, pleasant night air wash over me, seemed to give him some comfort. Now that I have practiced a lot and am confident, I am able to do complex combinations of movements, such as swirling forward, backward, left, right, and up and down, with the freedom I want, without ever getting confused. It has become. If you feel like it, you can easily try increasing the flight speed to some extent or vice versa. At the moment , I don't have any other work to do, so it's like the loneliness of a child playing alone with no friends. As you gradually change the location, the range of your activities will expand before you know it.
Later on, he began to make discoveries that were even more meaningful to him. It was a pitch-black night, with no rain, no moon or stars to be seen, but at that time even the wind had completely stopped blowing, leaving the strangely warm air stagnant and moist. That night, as he continued to float aimlessly and lonely at this arbitrary height, he suddenly felt a faint sense of something like a very subtle presence in the sky. It felt like it was. He had no idea what it was like. I remembered that I had had a similar experience before, when I had a premonition, and just watched it, so this time I was extremely nervous and listened carefully. However, it doesn't seem like it's a particularly weak sound wave sign...Although I can't see it, that subtle presence seems to be floating somewhere in the air, just like me. Moreover, it wasn't just one or two, but I had the feeling that they were coming closer to me and then moving further away. As I strained my eyesight, I could finally make out what appeared to be faint clumps of light floating in the air, not just my imagination, but also vaguely pale. ...Then, perhaps those people are of the same kind as me? That's how I feel. If that's the case, wouldn't it mean that there are probably many other nameless souls besides me who weren't able to die peacefully at that time? As I gaze at it with a heart that wants to believe in it, a sense of familiarity and a feeling akin to joy begin to warmly fill my insides. That's right, I wasn't as alone as I thought I was: I didn't have any inkling of this happening, but I was always so lost in my own sense of loneliness that I didn't feel like I was in the presence of other spirits. We have neglected our efforts to imagine their existence. When it came to my own feelings, I was still childish, at least immature, and uncertain. Perhaps that's why, even when I fly too close to them, I inadvertently miss the faint rays of starlight. However, from now on, I will have friends of the same kind! In the world of the living, I hope to find someone who will grieve their death from the bottom of my heart, and who will never forget and keep the memories of my love and regret in my heart, just as I did in my own case. As long as those forsaken, lonely spirits, who have none in the world, survive, he speeds up and approaches those faint masses with eagerness. Now, it wasn't just his imagination, but he was able to recognize the pale pale light floating in the air . Slow down your speed and try to fly past that familiar place, constantly being aware of the opponent's presence. Then, I felt like there was something that seemed like a faint reaction. This time, the next faint light seems to be sending a sign of intimacy to me. Feeling happy, he continued flying again. Changing direction, rising, reversing and falling at will, like a bat gone mad in ecstasy, he traversed the wide expanses of the dark night until he was exhausted. I keep jumping to... I don't know their gender or age, and I wonder if those spirits, who don't even have names just like me, understand our existence to the same extent as I do. A simple question suddenly comes to mind. Over and over again, he purposefully brushed his body against the person who seemed to be moving about freely. Even if they were able to fly through the air entwined like two humble butterflies, it was impossible for them to desire to merge into one. Although we can feel the spirits of the dead, we cannot speak the words they used when they were alive, so there is no way to communicate with each other.
Yoshie stared at Kinue's business-like face, tears welling up in his eyes from serious pain, and begged for forgiveness. Although she had no desire to eat at all, she was complaining that having to eat a fixed amount of food was the greatest pain for her. Kinue felt a pang of pain in her heart as she saw her daughter's behavior, and instinctively turned her head to the side, holding back her emotions for a moment.
When he wakes up, he constantly presses his left shoulder with his right hand and complains. Her eyes, filled with tears, dimmed with pain, and her unspoken pleas seemed to pierce the other person's heart. Kinue blinked at her bulging eyes, and the feeling of being squeezed in her throat made her suffocate.
Seeing Yoshie struggle in his arms because Kinue was holding him too tightly, Ryusuke patted Kinue on the shoulder and laid him down on the bed. Then, Yoshiko also asked Ryusuke to hold him once. Ryusuke hugged her again. Yoshie calmly closed his eyelids, feeling relieved. When Ryusuke put his ear to the tip of her nose, he could hear a faint breath coming out. Ryusuke gently put Yoshie to bed so as not to wake him.
Kinue picked up the dishes and was eating some food, but Ryoto's words made her feel depressed inside, and she felt tears welling up between her eyelids.
This was different from the deaths of his classmates who were all wiped out by the atomic bombing.
 The upper part of Ogoe's earlobe, shriveled like a dried shiitake mushroom, was missing. When Ogoe placed the tip of his index finger on the missing part with a familiar touch , the space filled in as if in an accent. Kazuo remembered how he had cried and cried under the mosquito net. The flies were so dense that the bare walls and ceilings of the barracks were no longer visible. They attacked Kazuo's festering wound and scratched it with their nails. The joy I felt when I couldn't resist and ran under the mosquito net came back to me.
A strong upperclassman wearing the uniform of a military academy said this as he turned his tanned face to the people around him. The first thing I did was to sprinkle some dirt on the edge of a chunk of brick wall and start peeling it off.ーー, the three of them told me. The first thing that appeared was a strand of hair stuck to the surface of the brick. Judging from the length of her somewhat brown hair, It made me imagine a schoolgirl. The reason I thought this was true was because next to it was a bag-stitched headband about five centimeters wide.
People greeted each other like this.
My father was seventy-one years old. The hollyhock, a perennial herb, has been in full bloom ever since the war, never missing a season. Considering that this year has already spanned more than half of his life, my father's post-war years have been a long, persistent and heavy time. My father ordered me to operate the handle to raise and lower the front half of the bed by rotating his index finger to the right, center, and left. However, he finally stopped making gestures that were incomprehensible to both my mother and me. He stretched out his arm above his head, clearly begging for some kind of change, with his wrists jerking upwards.What on earth was that? Gathering whatever sanity he still had , my father tried desperately to speak. What was that gesture that I couldn't help but repeat over and over again , both of us in a state of frustration ? What kind of transformation could have happened there?
My younger brother, an electrician with a strong physique, says this while breathing out his freezing breath. I tried to answer, but I was already speechless. When we finally reached the top of the hill, all three of us stopped and gasped as we looked out at the pale blue hail that descended upon the group of graves at the bottom of the cliff. I can see the red lights of a police car parked on the slope beyond the cemetery. The police showed no signs of saying anything to the group of people who were carrying raw corpses, which is illegal because they were not carrying them in coffins. However, the fact that I did not move made me feel that they were staring at me. We were nervous. While they were suffering and getting tired, their lights continued to spin brightly, cutting off the raindrops all around them.
Take the elevator down from the fifth floor. In the waiting room of an outpatient clinic, which would be crowded during the day, only the chairs were sunk neatly into the darkness. That was the first time my mother mentioned being cold.
———”
The Hiroshima accent that came out of his mouth left a sad impression on Tsuzaki.
The situation is no longer just a shady matter of abortion. Nachi's pregnancy thrust her into a painful battle with all kinds of severe fears and anxieties over the past 28 years, from the moment the atomic bomb was dropped. Tsuzaki now realizes that Nachi's slow, erratic movements and habit of walking with a limp are not actually due to her personality, but are due to atomic bomb syndrome neurosis, or perhaps a latent atomic bomb syndrome itself. I was gripped by a painful feeling when I realized that this was not the case.
Even so, Hosa Tsuzaki was surprised when his relationship with Nachi began four months ago. When I awoke, I found a young man sleeping on the couch in the living room or on the bottom shelf of a four-and-a-half tatami closet.
For the first time since arriving in Hiroshima, Tsuzaki exclaimed in a cheerful mood.
The teacher glanced at Arai and his friends' cap badges, turned his head away, and glanced toward the field of dust that Arai and his friends were walking through. Arai felt that this man was waiting for a specific person, or an unspecified number of people. For there was a sadness in his face, full of human love.
Sasada took Arai's right leg and carefully examined the inside of it. There's something extremely kind about Sasada. This has been the case since junior high school, but ever since he came here as part of the labor mobilization, his kindness has become even more noticeable. As the food situation worsens, work becomes harder, and everyone else becomes busy taking care of themselves, Sasada becomes kinder. His Christianity may be real. It is common among young people to feel ashamed of the wealth of one's family. Sasada once went to Arai. What should a son do when his father is a good man and he cannot respect him?One day, I overheard his father telling him to give up the shop to a man who had been a boy in his grandfather's generation. My grandfather was a soybean oil dealer. My father closed a shop that was not suitable for him and started an ironworks business elsewhere. My father probably didn't need an old soybean oil store or warehouse. Why did you ask me to give it up? The little hater, who was already forty at that time, was crying and begging his father. Was his father dissatisfied with the fact that he was so plain-minded that his store was not prosperous and he could only collect a small amount of rent? Or was there some kind of quarrel? Anyway, his father kicked him out. I was looking forward to seeing what kind of people would come, but no one came. This was because the war had gotten so bad that my father, the man I was counting on, was unable to start a soy sauce business. Since then, I have been unable to let go of my desire to oppose my father.
Arai then thought he had to visit his grave. It wasn't out of any sense of ancestor worship. Because I would be buried there.
I kept seeing the faces of my father, mother, and younger brother. Arai also thought it was his last time. Arai was aware that he had little love for his immediate family. :：：
When we stepped outside, the blue curtains on the glass wall facing the street had been pulled open, revealing a sparkling chandelier in the shape of a teal-colored brandy glass. When I casually peeked inside, I saw the hostess with one elbow resting on the counter, looking at me. The lights and glass partitions blurred the outlines of his white face, his eyelids were doubled over from fatigue, and the eyes behind them were shining brightly. However, I don't think she recognized me, she was just feeling depressed.
There weren't even any tears in my eyes. However, as a huge black bird-like shadow ran across the sky above the burning city, that scream was heard again. When he woke up, Nobuko had crawled into his futon and had fallen asleep with her back pressed against him. Nobuko's back was indeed cold, and she felt stiff as she remembered the time she had touched her father's corpse, but Nobuko's back was breathing. Then, once again, life began to sink into my weakened heart.
The coffee shop had been bequeathed to Nobuko. Although Nobuko already knew about this in her suicide note, she did not reveal it to us. No, in the end I didn't confess. The store had continued to operate as usual even after the owner's death, so when Kurosaki asked Nobuko about the current owner, Nobuko's reply was vague, which made him curious. Kurosaki asked me casually, but of course there was no way I knew. With a tattered dictionary and an engineering dictionary in hand, I managed to translate the plant assembly instructions and some contracts between Pakistan and a shipbuilding company that Kurosaki had brought home. Not only did I not clean this house, I did not open or close the shutters in the morning or evening. On the other hand, Kurosaki was the one who opened the shutters. In the evening, when I was feeling groggy and tired from work, the shutters in front of me suddenly started to make noises and move behind the glass door.Kurosaki, who was supposed to be by my side a moment ago, went outside to close it. That's what I was thinking. The house had been razed to the ground by the blast from the atomic bomb, and the shutters were not even able to move from inside, so Kurosaki had no choice but to go outside and open and close them. I felt a strange sense of satisfaction as I watched the shutters close and the twilight sky disappear.
said Kurosaki. Until then, Kurosaki had almost forgotten about Nobuko and had been living locked away in his own pain. Kurosaki asked, gasping in surprise. He still didn't understand the situation and mistakenly thought that the girl had attempted suicide.
Hiranuma said.
He glanced at me. And with his quick eyes, he also glanced at the wrapping paper I was holding.
I said vaguely.
After that, the two dying Indians and one white guy who was also dying began to live together in a poorly lit treatment ward, but in any case, this man named Glenn remained motionless and without money. Even though he was an honest white man, he must have been shocked to find himself sleeping with the Indians, and when he woke up in the morning, he was screaming. Ron's line started the day with his line, and then things continued. Until recently, he had been working on a ranch in a nearby rural town, but his physical condition had become so weak that Niche and Thatch had stopped working, and he was sent here.He was penniless, just like us, and unlike us, he had a white skin with hangnails. Other than the fact that he was a man with reddish-brown hair, the Marines must have been the only seeds that were coming at us. There are stories about how he beat up today's chubby young men with all his might when he was a recruit trainer in the Marines, and stories about how he pulled off a brawl against a limp conscript from the Army in Okinawa, and of course stories about Vietnam all the time. How many bastard gooks did you kill? That's what I said. He was so loud and boastful about the Marine Corps, so I got angry and told him about the idiot who came to Vietnam with only one of my nephew's left arms, and Glenn started talking about the fact that there were Indians in the Marine Corps. Either he didn't know about it, or maybe he knew it, but he looked like he didn't know about it, and his face suddenly looked like something disgusting had been forced into his mouth, but he quickly regained his composure. I started saying it. No, he didn't just start saying that, he reached into the bag that looked like a waste bag of dirty canvas bags that he had kept under the bed, took a long time to pick it up, and pulled out a medal that looked like a Priki toy from inside. he exclaimed.
 Ron slowly turned his head to look at the sickly and sickly face of Glen, the head guy next to him.
This is what I shouted. I could even hear my own voice. A building that looked like a white sugar candy that I had seen in the photo came into view in the lower front. exclaimed Glenn———Sergeant Glenn Tiller in a slow, sobbing voice. Of course, he was laughing out loud. Ron warned, but Crying Man and Crying Laughing Man continued to scream. In front of the white sugar candy, the green grass spreads out vividly. two ports
There is no need to consider such clichés any further. Once it begins to revive openly, there is no doubt that it will run down a steep slope. This is the history that we experienced in the lead up to the horrors of the Pacific War, and that we must not have forgotten yet.
Once you bring out the word God in this way, you will be reminded of the connection between the words God is supposed to protect the so-called liberal nation and lead the nation to victory. When we lost the Pacific War, we did so, but we did not think or put into practice a fundamental overhaul of the absolute imperial system that was the reason for our defeat. Given this, it is not difficult to imagine the Japanese families of tomorrow who will be huddled against the walls of nuclear shelters, vowing to each other that the only way to live is to die in front of them. I think that this other Japanese theory will be widely seen as very realistic in the very near future. Newspapers are saying that the word "already" is making a comeback, and I myself am not immune to anonymous communications that insult me in this way.
The following words by Senincourt were often quoted by the late Kazuo Watanabe, an expert on French humanism: ``Humans can perish. Might be so. But let us perish while resisting, and let us not be right if nothingness is reserved for us. )) I continue to find encouragement in these words, just as they have supported me in the past. However, when we think again about our planet, which is covered in nuclear weapons, we realize that the progress of international relations is not only in the direction of nuclear abolition, or at least in the direction of nuclear disarmament, but also in the direction of accumulating new types of nuclear weapons. Why don't you admit it? Now that I have no choice but to accept that the words "human beings can perish" literally mean the extinction of humanity, what is the point in me secretly resisting and perishing? I insist on the injustice of nothingness. What's the point in continuing to do this and diving into that emptiness?I feel completely helpless. However, while writers like me tend to be easily influenced by hessimism, there are also writers who work with today's international relations in mind, but display a strange optimism when it comes to the nuclear situation. However, if we examine the content of that optimism, it should become clear that it represents a strange distortion. Moreover, it is not that the writer in question is ignorant or naive, but rather that he did not listen to lectures from Defense Agency officials, and his optimism is evident in the novel that he wrote with overtly obvious political intentions. It is because it appears. Although he is known as a writer, Shintaro Ishihara, whose main activity is now as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party's hawkish Diet, is ``The Lost Country.''
At the same time, however, U.S. President Ronald Reagan resumed production of neutron bombs, promoted the commercialization of MX missiles, fielded air-launched cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads, deployed submarine-launched cruise missiles, and deployed theater nuclear missiles. When I read a newspaper report that they were determined to persist through the deployment to Europe, I felt a renewed sense of helplessness. US President Ronald Reagan is said to have begun strengthening his country's nuclear arsenals in consideration of the balance of nuclear military power between the United States and the Soviet Union over the next 20 years. The president of the United States and his closest aides believe that a world covered in nuclear weapons of such magnitude could continue to exist for 30 years without exploding and causing death to other living things. , because they are often considered to be the most optimistic people. In the words of Vonnegut, we are holding the fate of our planet in the hands of these politicians.
Both are said to be blood cancers, and there is currently no life-saving treatment. The blood in my body is not being regenerated (the blood that is currently flowing will be replaced with new blood in two weeks).I didn't know anything about this, but in the ``City of Corpses'', I started seeing humans starting around August 20th. I wrote only the fact that a person dies when they die, but it has now been scientifically proven that death occurs when every drop of the original blood is consumed. However, when I went to Hiroshima two years ago, I took my mother to the JRCS Hospital and had my white blood cells and red blood cells tested. Even if I went there because I was sick, a purple ink stamp that said ``I'm sick'' would be stamped firmly on the shoulder of my medical record. Even people like Kikichi Aono have said this in monthly reviews of his works.
Regarding the fact that I have been ill for a while now, there is a lot of misunderstanding about the name of the disease, and this is not a personal problem, so I would like to write about it as much as I can. In Hiroshima, members of Midori no Kai and Izumi Kai have come together to create the Hiroshima Cultural Circle Center. These coterie members created a small newsletter, and in that paper they reported that I had become a . However, since I am not a typical person and this misconception seems to be common, I would like to write about it at least once. I have never once written or said that it was me, but when I get sick, I come across people other than doctors saying that I have atomic bomb disease, and I get nervous. I want to say, ``Please wait a moment.'' Thirteen people from that gathering wrote messages to comfort me and encourage me. I can't list them all, but I have written the following on my own stationery and manuscript paper.
About me I am currently in Shimoda, Izu. They have been here since mid-January and have passed the winter. Although it was a cheap wooden inn on the southern tip of Izu, the fact that I was spending all my time living in an inn must have been a relaxing experience under normal circumstances. However, in the small port town of Minami Izu, violent westerly winds blow almost every day. It also rains a lot. The day after the rain, a strong westerly wind blows, just as it did in the paper. Due to the poor catch, a large number of fishermen wearing rubber long hats and stinky fish are wandering around the town.
I think it was just a matter of fainting from the blast. - The Chugoku Shimbun newspaper from the year before last reported that radioactivity was present in the air, water, vegetables, and pigs of Hiroshima City not only on the morning of August 6, 19945, but also for a long time thereafter. Hiroshima) has invited Dr. Masao Tsuzuki to clarify.
It was a fine spring day. It was a peaceful morning, not suitable for exhuming a corpse.
On the third day, I saw the corpse from the previous day stripped naked again. Kazuo also knelt down and put his hands together. On the way home, my father clasped his hands together and repeated the words ``Namuamidabu'' to the dead men and women in their pants and pants that day.
After my mother took her last breath, my father returned. Although my mother expected his death, she did not allow me to inform my father. My mother remained conscious until her death. Atomic bomb disease killed my mother. Her liver, uterus, and even her skin were infected with cancer, and she lost weight and died. Early the next morning, my father arrived in Hiroshima overnight. My father removed the white cloth from his face and stared at me without blinking. Without saying a word or crying, I stared at my mother as if trying to penetrate her. Miki felt like he couldn't handle it anymore, and his heart tightened as he looked at his father, looked at his mother, and thought about what was going on in his father's heart. Miki felt a renewed sense of mourning for his father.
--My acquaintances went to the prefectural convention today as well. That's when I feel envy. And I feel frustrated.
In early August, a few months after Mr. Y's letter, Mr. Y again informed me that Mr. K was hospitalized. He had been hospitalized since July, and the letters describing the progress of his illness were hurriedly disorganized, conveying the severity of Mr. к's illness and the oscillations of Mr. Y's heartache. And it was a telegram that passed away before I could even write a reply. Simply put, to put it simply, Mr. K's illness was liver cancer.
I eventually get out of the cup and pour hot water onto the roof. If you flush it all at once, it will overflow into the gutter and the hot water will flow into the second floor window in the back. Even while I was taking a bath, my friends were waiting for me in the room next door, chatting. Even in that presence, I felt the friendship and consideration of these people. Thank you for your consideration, this was not just a hastily built bathing area . When I heard that from Mr. Y, I couldn't believe it. Mr. к answered casually. That being said,
I saw Mr. K's painting that I was looking for once at this exhibition several years ago. Considering the friendship I have with Mr. к, the fact that I only saw Mr. к's paintings once at the exhibition, even though he had always exhibited them at this exhibition for over ten years, was a complete remiss. When Mr. K exhibited his own paintings, he did not always travel to Tokyo to accompany them. Now that I think about it, I wonder if that was due to travel expenses. So when I came to see Mr. K's paintings at this venue a few years ago, I wrote a letter to Mr. K, who didn't see it, and let him know how I felt at the venue. The two paintings by Mr. K that were on display at this venue at that time were soft, pink-based landscapes with an elegant feel. This person's gentle nature and a kind of difficult temperament were clearly expressed, and her gentle beauty had a firmness and sharpness to it. It felt like Mr. K's personality and appearance were exactly the same. Mr. K's appearance was rather that of a man with a straight nose and thick eyebrows, but at the time he was suffering from a chest problem, and although his gaze was bright and clear, there was a hint of grumpiness in his eyes. there was. When I imagined him writing a leaflet for the Communist Party, I had no idea what kind of leaflet it was. However, Mr. K's paintings at that time had beautiful colors. Today I'm here to see Mr. K's posthumous paintings. It was a few days ago that Mr. K's younger brother, Mr. I, came to Tokyo from Nagasaki, bringing with him some of Mr. K's late works. Mr. Y came to Tokyo with me because he wanted to see Mr. к's last exhibited painting in the place where it would be exhibited. Ms. Y is Mr. I's sister-in-law, but Ms. Y is not Mr. K's wife. Mr. Y is single. Mr. Y's sister marries Mr. I and they become step-sisters and brother-in-law. Therefore, Mr. к is also a brother and sister-in-law, but even before they became related by marriage, Mr. Y was Mr. K's closest friend and supporter of his work. At the same time, for Mr. Y, an overseas Chinese living in Nagasaki, Mr. K must have been a source of emotional support for Mr. Y. I know some of the interactions between Mr. K and Mr. Y. Not even a month had passed since Mr. K's death, and Mr. Y and Mr. I, who had come to Tokyo with two of his posthumous works, were deeply moved by this exhibition.
The watcher said with a wry smile. Hana replaced the large crimson artificial flower that had fallen from the tip of the young man's spear in her hair. Suzuki muttered, feeling embarrassed.
Suzuki was having trouble breathing. The new species of animals were showing off in front of him in their full glory. Blind, but lively. It swamped him, making him feel uneasy. Hana speaks. That low voice is a profane voice that breaks the tension of the sacred concert.
Suzuki had heard and knew for a long time that the interior of the Permanent Hall was a magnificent sight to behold. The huge building towering over the coast was designed by the Minister of War and was completed only a year ago. Surrounded by thick gray walls, the circular Permanent Hall looked from a distance like a strong fortress or an airy prison. It looked like a secret factory, or a Greek or Roman stadium, or some kind of sacred temple. This circular monster contains a strange content that no other building has ever given.The surface of the distant sea froths in the fierce wind, and the sun rolls under the heavy gray sky. It has a particularly mysterious appearance.
Scarlet, red, purple, yellow and black dandaras, and the white of the smoke that remained. A number of fire engines passed by, each color showing each stage of the fire. A group of white fingers circle around on top of the official fire engine, running free white lines as they rush joyfully to their festival site. Two white military police motorcycles were pulled alongside the Suzuki car. The radio wave detection antenna attached to the motorcycle shone and shone like the whiskers of a beetle. Before the guard alerted him, Suzuki instinctively pulled out an aluminum pass from his breast pocket. Taking the all-purpose pass handed to him in the palm of his hand, the military policeman clicked the heels of his shoes together and repeated the raised hand salute he had once done. The military policeman was a large man, one and a half times the size of a normal citizen, and with his Suzuki talisman, both of them stood out. But I couldn't let the military police's surprise show on their faces. This is because they were both wearing strange masks.
The Mokugyo in the preaching hall started chiming again this morning.
Lightning is flashing.
It's Saturday. The horn of my uncle's publica will sound soon. The brothers run. Dad, Okaerina Sai. The two of them pull on the edges of Uncle Cha's clothes as he returns home, carrying a package of dessert sweets and ringing his car keys. touch the key. Aki could see it. Six palms like pressed flowers opened on the window glass of the room the brothers had run up to.
While my father was working with iron on a pine tree in the garden near the mountain, he accidentally fell from a high pedestal onto a stone masonry.The spot was so bad that he died, and then my mother took me, who was very young, to the house. I still remember that my wife, like my mother, was still young when she became troublesome. Even though we were able to build our old shop with lumber, we still owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Murakawa's husband and wife for temporarily helping us with our lives, as the accident occurred while tending to the garden trees. Growing up, my mother often told me that if I forgot something, it would be a sled or a demon. I'm a little hard of hearing, so it bothers me that people sometimes get mad at me for the wrong reasons, but as they say, there are no bad people among people who are hard of hearing, and my wife is very intelligent and is afraid of liars. However, I was also told that it could cause a loss. How lonely it must have been to have been seriously ill since coming to Tokyo...
A Tenpo Sendai rubber stamp was also stamped on that young man's medical record. Red, stamp ink ! It was pressed against the top right corner of the white medical record and caught Kensaku's eye. The same stamp is stamped on the first page of his medical record.
 Holding his head down, Kensaku continued to roll on his side as well.
While massaging the area after the injection,
and Sone. He thought her face must be distorted as she answered. Silver flies multiply in countless numbers, swell into irregular shapes, deflate, and flow. A dazzling flicker of yellow, red, purple, and green. My ears have started ringing, and when I hear a continuous ringing in the bottom of my ears, I get a pain that feels like my skull is cracking.
